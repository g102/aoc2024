# AOC 2024
Solved in C++23.

## Compile
Compile with CMake - every day is its own separate target, named like its folder (`day01` to `day25`).

To build all targets:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cd ..
cmake --build build
```
All executables are in the same folder as the source code.

## Run
To run, either launch the executables from the shell, or use the helper Python code: `python run_day.py ##`, where `##` is the day number.

Ensure the input file is in the same folder as the executable and named `input.txt`. Otherwise, specify the input file path as the first argument to each executable.
